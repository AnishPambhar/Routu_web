    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last updated: 15 August 2025</p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”) govern the relationship between Routo and its users...</p>

    <h2 id="legal">Legal Basis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Indian Contract Act, 1872 – Governing contractual obligations.</li>
      <li>Information Technology Act, 2000 – Governing electronic records and online transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="scope">Scope of Application</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions are divided into the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Section A – Vendor Terms & Conditions</li>
      <li>Section B – Customer Terms & Conditions</li>
      <li>Section C – Send Parcel Service – Customer Terms & Conditions</li>
      <li>Section D – Traveler Terms & Conditions</li>
    </ul>

  
<h2 id="sectionA">SECTION A – Vendor Terms & Conditions</h2>

<h3>1. Product Returns & Delivery Charges</h3>
<p><strong>1.1</strong> If a customer returns a product due to damage, defect, incorrect item, expired goods, or other valid causes, you, the Vendor, shall bear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The return shipping/delivery charges</li>
  <li>Any replacement shipping charges (if applicable)</li>
  <li>Any applicable compensation mandated under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 – Section 17</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2</strong> Return charges shall not be deducted from the customer’s refund.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Example:</strong> If a customer orders a fresh cake and receives a stale or damaged cake, you will pay for the reverse pickup cost and resend a fresh cake at your expense.</p>

<hr />

<h3>2. Payment Settlement Process</h3>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> After an order is successfully delivered and accepted by the customer, Routeo will release payment to you after deducting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Platform commission (18%–20%)</li>
  <li>Applicable Goods and Services Tax (GST)</li>
  <li>Any penalties or adjustments (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.2</strong> Settlement timelines will be [X working days], subject to banking delays.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Example:</strong> If you sell a product for ₹1000 and the commission is 18%, you will receive ₹820 minus applicable GST and adjustments.</p>

<hr />

<h3>3. Vendor Registration & Document Verification</h3>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> All documents submitted during registration (e.g., GST Certificate, FSSAI License, Aadhaar, PAN) must be genuine, valid, and up to date.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> Submitting false, forged, or expired documents will result in <strong>IMMEDIATE TERMINATION</strong> without prior notice under IPC Section 420 (Cheating) and possible legal prosecution.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> Routeo reserves the right to conduct random audits.</p>

<hr />

<h3>4. Stock Management & Order Availability</h3>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> Vendors must update product availability in real time.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> If an item is out of stock, you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Immediately mark it as “Out of Stock” on the platform, or</li>
  <li>Restock and update inventory status within 2 hours</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.3</strong> Repeated acceptance of orders for unavailable products will lead to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduction of shop rating</li>
  <li>Temporary suspension</li>
  <li>Public flagging of your shop profile</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you keep accepting orders for a pizza that is not available and cancel later, your rating will drop, affecting customer trust.</p>

<hr />

<h3>5. Product Quality & Accuracy</h3>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> You must deliver exactly what is described in the listing — correct brand, size, weight, type, and quality.</p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong> If delivering food items, ensure compliance with Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.</p>
<p><strong>5.3</strong> Any misrepresentation or substitution (e.g., giving mutton biryani instead of vegetable biryani) will make you fully liable for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Refunds</li>
  <li>Compensation</li>
  <li>Legal penalties under Section 272 IPC (Adulteration of Food)</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="sectionB">SECTION B – Customer Terms & Conditions</h2>

<p>These terms apply to all individuals or entities who purchase products, place orders, or use any delivery-related services via Routeo. By placing an order, you agree to comply with these conditions along with applicable laws, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consumer Protection Act, 2019</li>
  <li>Indian Contract Act, 1872</li>
  <li>Information Technology Act, 2000</li>
  <li>Indian Penal Code, 1860</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>1. Order Acceptance, Cancellation & Refund Eligibility</h3>

<h4>1.1 Placing an Order</h4>
<ul>
  <li>When you place an order on Routeo, it constitutes a binding contract under Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.</li>
  <li>Orders are subject to vendor confirmation and availability.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.2 Order Cancellation Before Acceptance</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the assigned traveler (delivery agent) has not yet accepted the order, you may cancel and receive a 100% refund without any charges.</li>
  <li>Refunds will be processed within 7 working days to your original payment method.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.3 Cancellation After Traveler Acceptance but Before Pickup</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the traveler has accepted the order but has not yet picked it up, cancellation will incur a cancellation fee of ₹[X] or a percentage of the order value, whichever is higher.</li>
  <li>This deduction covers administrative and time-based costs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.4 Cancellation After Pickup or at Time of Delivery</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you cancel after the traveler has picked up your order or when the traveler arrives for delivery, you shall pay:
    <ul>
      <li>Double the delivery charge</li>
      <li>The standard cancellation fee</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These charges will either be collected immediately or added to your next order bill.</li>
  <li>This policy is supported by Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (Penalty for breach of contract).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You order groceries worth ₹500 with ₹50 delivery fee. If you cancel after pickup, you will pay ₹100 (double delivery fee) + ₹20 cancellation fee = ₹120 penalty.</p>

<hr />

<h3>2. Incorrect, Damaged, or Mismatched Items</h3>

<h4>2.1 Vendor Responsibility</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you receive the wrong product, the vendor is liable under Section 17 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (Deficiency in goods/services).</li>
  <li>The platform (Routeo) will facilitate communication but is not responsible for product mismatches.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.2 Mismatched Food Orders</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you receive a product of a different category than ordered — such as non-vegetarian food instead of vegetarian — and consume it, you waive the right to claim damages from Routeo.</li>
  <li>Any claims for health impact, religious concerns, or dietary restrictions will be directed solely to the vendor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you order vegetarian pulao and receive chicken pulao, Routeo will not be responsible for the mismatch once consumed.</p>

<hr />

<h3>3. Returns Policy</h3>

<h4>3.1 Return Window</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Returns must be initiated within 1 hour of receiving the delivery, failing which the item is deemed accepted.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.2 Return Process for Prepaid Orders</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Refunds will be issued within 7 working days after deduction of applicable return handling charges.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.3 Return Process for COD Orders</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If payment was made via Cash on Delivery and the return is approved, refunds will be processed to your bank account within 7 working days.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.4 Non-Returnable Items</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Certain items (e.g., perishable goods, customized orders) cannot be returned unless defective or damaged.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>4. Cash-on-Delivery (COD) Non-Payment</h3>

<h4>4.1 Obligation to Pay</h4>
<ul>
  <li>By placing a COD order, you agree to pay the full order value upon delivery.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.2 Refusal to Pay</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you refuse payment without valid reason:
    <ul>
      <li>Your account will be permanently banned</li>
      <li>Legal action will be taken under IPC Section 415 &amp; 420 (Cheating and dishonest misrepresentation).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Ordering electronics worth ₹5,000 COD and refusing payment without valid reason will lead to a legal recovery notice.</p>

<hr />

<h3>5. Refund Processing Timeline</h3>

<h4>5.1 Standard Refund Time</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Refunds for cancelled or returned orders will be processed within 7 working days from approval.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.2 Bank Delays</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Routeo will not be responsible for delays caused by your bank, payment gateway, or financial institution.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.3 Refund Method</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Refunds will be made to the original payment method unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>6. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provide accurate delivery address and contact details.</li>
  <li>Be available to receive the order within the estimated delivery time.</li>

</ul>

<h4>1.2 No Guarantee for High-Value Items</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Routeo strongly advises against sending high-value, irreplaceable, or fragile items unless covered under Routeo’s Parcel Insurance Policy (refer to Clause 3.3).</li>

<h4>4.2 Partial Compensation from Routeo</h4>

</ul>

<h4>4.3 Packaging Requirement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is your responsibility to ensure proper packaging to prevent transit damage.</li>
  <li>Poor packaging that directly results in damage will void any compensation claims.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you send a laptop in only a thin plastic bag and it arrives broken, compensation will not be provided.</p>

<hr />

<h3>5. Delivery Timelines &amp; Delays</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Timelines provided are estimates and may vary due to traffic, weather, or unforeseen events.</li>
